# Coding-Quizz

## Description


This project will demonstrate my skills as a developer by coding a time quiz with multiple-choice-questions. User wills be able to answer four coding based quiz questions from four answer options. If correct answer is clicked user will have a "correct" alert and proceed to the next question. If user click incorrect answer a "incorrect" alert will display, user will then lose 15 seconds from the counter before proceeding to the next question. Remaining time is used to calculate score. After the fourth question or if the counter reaches 0 user will be able to submit there name and score to a leaderboard which is saved in the localStorage.

This project takes advantage of many skills as a developer such as; HTML structure, CSS formationg, buttons, arrays, objects, if (and else) statement, functions, events, storing and collecting information from localStorage.
